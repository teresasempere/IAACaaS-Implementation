                <p>
                    In the new Internet paradigm, where data economy is becoming a key element for companies success,
                    along with the increasing concern of performing a sustainable development of their activities, the
                    integration IoT devices in their ecosystems take special relevance. By 2020 the number of connected
                    devices generating tons of sensitive data (sensors) or awaiting a request to trigger some reaction
                    (actuators) will reach 26 billion. These devices usually have low computing capabilities and work
                    over networks with limited connectivity. In this scenario, ensuring privacy, access control and
                    identity management without implying a considerable decrement in performance, scalability or
                    interoperability is really tricky.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Currently, there are several approaches to handle identity management and access control only for
                    end users but not so many which also include IoT Systems management. Moreover, they do not cover all
                    the requirements in terms of security or efficiency.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The aim of this project is to conduct an investigation on how can be implemented an IoT model that
                    satisfies these requirements. This model, which is called IAACaaS [referencia] (IoT
                    Application-Scoped Access Control as a Service), is an access control approach for IoT scenarios
                    based on <a href="#">OAuth2.0</a> authorization framework together with RBAC (Role Based Access
                    Control) and ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) authorization policies definition.
                    This solution would allow not only the management of all IoT devices deployed in an ecosystem but
                    also a flexible way of defining authorization policies to control requests from them as well as
                    requests sent to them depends on who access to the IoT device and behalf of which service. It will
                    be also studied how the inclusion of lightweight authentication and authorization mechanisms affect
                    in terms of computational load, performance or even energy efficiency of devices and compare the
                    results with other IoT security approaches.
